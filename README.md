 Task Description: Text Generation Using LSTM
Objective:
To build a text generation model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks that can generate coherent and contextually relevant paragraphs based on user-defined seed text.

Overview:
This project demonstrates how sequential deep learning techniques can be applied to natural language generation. A small custom corpus on a specific topic (e.g., technology) is used to train an LSTM model. The trained model learns the context and structure of the language and is then able to generate new text sequences given a starting phrase.

Steps Involved:

Data Collection: A small paragraph-based corpus is used (can be topic-specific).

Preprocessing: The text is tokenized, and n-gram sequences are created to form training data.

Model Building: An LSTM-based neural network is built using TensorFlow/Keras.

Training: The model is trained on the input sequences to predict the next word in a sequence.

Text Generation: A user provides a seed phrase, and the model generates a continuation of the sentence or paragraph.

Tools and Libraries:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Use Case Examples:

Generating technology-themed articles

Auto-completion or content suggestions

AI-based creative writing
